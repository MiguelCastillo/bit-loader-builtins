> Plugin for handling nodejs builtin modules in bit-bundler.

It uses all the builtins from [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to provide all the shimmed modules.

All the stuff was basically possible because of all amazing of work by James Halliday (substack) and other amazing people from the community who got all this stuff working.  I am merely taking their work and fitting it into bit-bundler as a plugin.  So... THANKS!!!
